          <p class="py-4">Thank you for supporting Malcrow financially. Supporting Malcrow allows me to affording hosting, domains, and other infrastructure for Malcrow and other projects. If you would like to, you can support Malcrow even more finanically or by promoting Malcrow by word-of-mouth or by contributing to the code, or even suggesting a feature. You deserve my sincere gratitude.

    <p class="py-4">For the people that are financially unable to support Malcrow, donating to us is not the only option. You can support us in many other ways. I will still give you full access to Malcrow completely for free, and I will stop nagging you. But here's some things I would like you to do if you cannot financially support us.
        <br>
    <li>Promote Malcrow via word-of-mouth or on social media! Try and recommend Malcrow to a friend or a relative.</li>
    <li>Contribute to the code! If you are able to, you can send a pull request on our GitHub, or report a bug or suggest a feature.</li>

        <p>Malcrow is FOSS but is <b>donationware</b>, that means you get Malcrow completely for free, but we would like you to pay for it. You are not obligated to pay, and if you cannot support us financially, you can do it in other ways.
        <br>Please select an option.
